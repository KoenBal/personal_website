## About

<p class="text-justify"> 
<!-- text-justify is bootstrap -->

I'm the founder of a proprietary crypto market-making hedge fund and QlikViewModules.com. I'm a financial data science analytics engineer with an MSc. degree in Mechanical Engineering and profound knowledge in quantitative finance, data visualization, and management. I get inspired by hard problems which when solved could have a substantial human impact. I'm passionate about financial inclusion, fintech, and decentralized finance.
<br>
I like designing and building analytics products, optimizing systems, creating structure, getting the details right, and automating using well documented and pythonic code. On a project, I bring new ideas to solve the complex underlying problems. I have a never-ending thirst for learning new concepts, skills, and improving my mental models. Even without being paid, I would still build products.
